Assignment 2: Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram Modeling
Symphonic Band is an orchestra that plays different types of concerts.  The orchestra’s popularity is growing fast, and they are starting to have problems keeping track of the musicians that should play in each concert as well as the musical works that are most suitable for the concert. Help the orchestra to create a database model, as a first step to implement a database, so that the orchestra can keep track of both musicians and musical works. The database model must represent the following points:· The orchestra plays three types of concerts: church concerts, private parties, and outdoor concerts.· The orchestra plays three types of music: classical, popular, and American folk. The orchestra always plays classical music in their church concerts. The orchestra always plays American folk on private parties. Finally, the orchestra plays a blend of the three types of music when playing outdoors.· It should be possible to find in the database the music works that are suitable for each type of concert so that the repertoire can be easily planned well in advance.· For each musical work, the database should store which musical setting (i.e. the instruments) are required to play the work.· The database should store information for each coming concert. The information should include the place, date and time of the concert as well as the type of concert and the repertoire that will be played.· For each musician in the orchestra, the database should store his/her name, the instrument that he/she plays, and in which of the coming concerts he/she will participate.requirements· You are required to develop a data model using an Extended Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD). The model should represent the information above, so that it can be used to automatically determine the applicability of each discount· Your model should provide entities, relationships, identifiers and minimum and maximum cardinality for each relationship. For each entity, you must indicate the identifier and other required attributes.· If used, composite attributes should be shown properly broken down into their simple components· Multivalued attributes should be converted into their own entities.· Add associative entities when needed, identifying their relevant attributes. You need two attributes at a minimum per asso代 写CS 350—Database Management Systems Fall 2024Matlab

Assumptions have to be made only if they are not clear in the above description. You can include the assumptions on the model using SmartDraw text tool. A list of unnecessary assumptions will be ignored.· Use the same model notations used in the textbook and slides and not from other courses or your own making. From within SmartDraw, choose Software Design then Entity Relationship Diagram template.Deliverable:

This is an individual assignment which means that your solution is entirely your own. Allow enough time to work on the assignment—for these assignments, assignments submitted late without prior notice will not be accepted.
There is no pre-grading review! You can ask clarification questions in-person during office hours or via email; I will only evaluate your solution once after the deadline. Multiple solutions can be uploaded to Brightspace, but only the last solution will be graded.
This assignment is based on Chapter 2 of the textbook and associated video.
#
Criteria
Points 
1
Understanding of EERD Concepts· Diagram demonstrates understanding of entities, attributes, relationships, subtypes, and cardinality and accurately defines key terms related to ERDs15
2
Entity Identification · Diagram identifies relevant entities based on the given scenario or problem and includes primary keys for each entity.15
3
Attribute Specification· Diagram lists attributes for each entity and includes data types and constraints (e.g., string, integer, etc.).15
4
Relationship Definition · Diagram defines relationships between entities (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) and specifies cardinality (optional, mandatory).20
5
Completeness and Correctness · Diagram ensures all relevant entities and relationships are included and avoids redundancy and inconsistency.20
6
Diagram Clarity· Diagram creates a clear and organized ERD using appropriate symbols (boxes, diamonds, lines) and labels entities and relationships clearly.15
